# Troll_ID

## Description
For the game Fall Guys, there are a lot of players that are annoying. Some try grab you at really mean moments, some try to push you off, some prolong the game intentionally, etc. This program lets you add the names of these players to a list. The program will then look in your current game for any of these players, and warn you if any of them are in your current lobby. That way you can try to avoid or kill them.

## Future Ideas:
- Display troll criminal records
- Make a GUI to easily add new trolls
- Track players that often make it to the end
